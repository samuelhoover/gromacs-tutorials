My solutions for the GROMACS tutorials hosted by [CompChems](https://www.compchems.com).

Completed:
- Chicken villin subdomain HP-35 in water
- Atomistic simulation of a protein in membrane environment

In progress:
- Coarse-grained simulation with Martini 3 force field (software incompatibilities that I'm trying to work around)

Not started:
- Coarse-grained simulation of a protein membrane system
